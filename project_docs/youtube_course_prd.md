# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## **Project: YouTube-to-Course Generation System**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 8, 2025  
**Author:** Product Development Team

---

## **Overview**

The YouTube-to-Course Generation System transforms unstructured YouTube video content into structured, interactive learning courses through AI-powered content analysis and question generation. This web-based platform addresses the critical gap between consuming video content and actual learning retention by automatically generating contextual quiz questions, extracting key concepts, and providing an AI learning assistant.

**Problem Statement:** Educational content creators spend countless hours manually creating quiz questions and course structure from video content, while learners passively consume videos without active engagement or knowledge retention mechanisms.

**Solution:** An AI-powered system that analyzes any YouTube video and automatically generates interactive course materials including segmented timelines, contextual quiz questions, and an intelligent tutoring assistant.

**Target Users:**
- **Primary:** Educational content creators, online instructors, corporate trainers
- **Secondary:** Self-directed learners, students, professional development participants

**Value Proposition:** Reduce course creation time from hours to minutes while increasing learner engagement and knowledge retention through AI-generated interactive elements.

## **Core Features**

### **1. AI-Powered Video Analysis**
**What it does:** Processes any YouTube video URL using Gemini 2.0 Flash API to extract educational content structure, key concepts, and generate contextual questions.

**Why it's important:** Eliminates the manual effort of content analysis and question creation, making course development accessible to creators without instructional design expertise.

**How it works:** Users input a YouTube URL, the system validates and extracts the video ID, sends video content to Gemini API for analysis, and receives structured data including concepts, segments, and quiz questions with confidence scores.

### **2. Interactive Course Creation Interface**
**What it does:** Provides a visual editor where creators can review, modify, and enhance AI-generated content before publishing courses.

**Why it's important:** Ensures content quality and creator control while maintaining the efficiency benefits of AI generation.

**How it works:** Displays the original video alongside AI-generated questions, segments, and concepts with confidence scores. Creators can accept/reject items, edit content, add custom annotations, and mark key concept areas.

### **3. Immutable Course Versioning**
**What it does:** Creates permanent, shareable versions of courses with unique public URLs that never change.

**Why it's important:** Allows iterative course improvement while maintaining stable access for learners and enabling content distribution without user accounts.

**How it works:** Each "Save Version" action generates a SHA-256 hash of complete course data, creates an immutable record, and provides a permanent public URL for learner access.

### **4. Contextual Learning Experience**
**What it does:** Delivers courses through a video player that automatically pauses at designated timestamps to present relevant quiz questions.

**Why it's important:** Transforms passive video watching into active learning with immediate knowledge reinforcement and retention testing.

**How it works:** Learners access courses via public URLs, video automatically pauses at question triggers, quiz overlay appears without obscuring video content, immediate feedback provided, and progress tracking maintained throughout session.

### **5. AI Learning Assistant**
**What it does:** Provides real-time, contextual responses to learner questions based on current video content and timestamp.

**Why it's important:** Offers immediate clarification and support without human instructor availability, enhancing comprehension and reducing learning barriers.

**How it works:** Chat interface captures learner questions, automatically pauses video and screenshots current frame, sends question with visual context to AI model, and delivers personalized responses based on video content.

## **Risks and Mitigations**

### **Technical Challenges**

**Risk:** Gemini API rate limits and costs
**Mitigation:** Implement request queuing, caching for repeated content, and usage monitoring with alerts. Develop fallback to manual content creation.

**Risk:** YouTube API changes or restrictions
**Mitigation:** Abstract YouTube integration behind service layer, implement multiple video platform support, and maintain robust error handling.

**Risk:** Video processing timeouts for long content
**Mitigation:** Implement chunked processing for videos >30 minutes, provide progress indicators, and offer resume functionality.

### **MVP Definition and Scope**

**Risk:** Feature creep preventing usable MVP delivery
**Mitigation:** Strict adherence to Phase 1 scope - manual course creation with versioning. AI features are enhancement, not requirement for initial value.

**Risk:** Over-engineering the AI integration
**Mitigation:** Start with simple API calls and basic confidence display. Advanced AI features can be iteratively improved post-MVP.

**Risk:** Premature optimization of performance
**Mitigation:** Focus on functional completeness first, then optimize based on actual usage patterns and performance metrics.

### **Resource Constraints**

**Risk:** AI processing costs exceeding budget
**Mitigation:** Implement usage caps, offer freemium model with processing limits, and optimize API calls to reduce token usage.

**Risk:** Database storage costs for JSONB course data
**Mitigation:** Implement data compression for course snapshots, archive old versions, and optimize JSON structure for storage efficiency.

**Risk:** Frontend complexity overwhelming development timeline
**Mitigation:** Use established component libraries (Tailwind, shadcn/ui) and focus on core user flows before advanced UI features.

### **User Adoption Risks**

**Risk:** Poor AI content quality reducing creator trust
**Mitigation:** Prominent confidence score display, easy editing tools, and clear messaging about AI assistance rather than replacement.

**Risk:** Complex course creation interface deterring users
**Mitigation:** Extensive user testing during Phase 2, progressive disclosure of advanced features, and comprehensive onboarding flow.

**Risk:** Limited course discoverability without user accounts
**Mitigation:** Focus on direct sharing via URLs initially, implement simple course directories in later phases, and enable social sharing features.
