## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### System Overview
```
YouTube URL → Video Processor → AI Analyzer → Course Generator → Database → Frontend
                    ↓               ↓              ↓           ↓
                Audio/Video → Content Analysis → Quiz Gen → Student UI
                    ↓               ↓              ↓           ↓
                Transcript → Structure → References → Instructor Dashboard
```

### Database Schema (Supabase)
```sql
-- Core entities
users (id, email, role, created_at)
courses (id, title, description, youtube_url, instructor_id, status)
course_modules (id, course_id, title, order, content)
course_lessons (id, module_id, title, video_timestamp, content)
quizzes (id, lesson_id, questions, correct_answers)
student_progress (id, user_id, course_id, completion_percentage)
student_quiz_attempts (id, user_id, quiz_id, score, answers)
course_analytics (course_id, total_students, avg_completion, etc.)
```

### AI Processing Pipeline
```javascript
// Step 1: Extract video data
const videoData = await extractYouTubeData(url);
const transcript = await transcribeAudio(videoData.audio);

// Step 2: Analyze content structure
const analysis = await analyzeContent(transcript, videoData.metadata);
const courseStructure = await generateCourseStructure(analysis);

// Step 3: Generate interactive content
const quizzes = await generateQuizzes(courseStructure);
const references = await verifyReferences(courseStructure);

// Step 4: Store in database
await createCourse(courseStructure, quizzes, references);
```
